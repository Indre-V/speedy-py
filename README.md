# Speedy-Py

Speedy-Py typing test is a tool designed to evaluate typing speed and accuracy. It provides users with a platform to assess their typing skills in terms of words per minute (WPM) and accuracy rate. The test typically presents users with a passage or a series of random words that they need to type accurately and swiftly within a specified time frame.

By practicing regularly with Speedy-Py, users can enhance their typing skills and become more efficient at keyboard-based tasks.

# User Experience (UX)

It is deployed to Heroku to ensure a seamless user experience for players.

##  Colour Scheme

The color scheme chosen for the HTML page with a terminal view was taken from the background image and was obtained from the <b>coolors.co</b> generator. The "run program" button's color was changed to blend in with the background.

![Colour Scheme](docs/docs/palette.png)

High contrast colors are used to show terminal outputs on a black background to improve readability and accessibility. Warnings are red, standard prompts are yellow, and inputs for are blue.Â Menus and confirmation messages are both green. 

## Design Choices

Background image is generated by [Gencraft](https://gencraft.com/ "Gencraft").

## Lighthouse Testing

....   tested in the [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) and [Microsoft Edge Dev Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide-chromium/open/?tabs=cmd-Windows) using Lighthouse Testing tool which inspects and scores the website for the following criteria:

* Performance - how quickly a website loads and how quickly users can access it.
* Accessibility - test analyses how well people who use assistive technologies can use your website.
* Best Practices - checks whether the page is built on the modern standards of web development.
* SEO - checks if the website is optimised for search engine result rankings.

# Speedy-Py

Speedy-Py typing test is a tool designed to evaluate typing speed and accuracy. It provides users with a platform to assess their typing skills in terms of words per minute (WPM) and accuracy rate. The test typically presents users with a passage or a series of random words that they need to type accurately and swiftly within a specified time frame.

By practicing regularly with Speedy-Py, users can enhance their typing skills and become more efficient at keyboard-based tasks.

# Logic

## Python Logic

A flow diagram of the logic behind the application was developed using [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/).

As the flow chart was created at the outset of the project, it does not fully reflect all elements of the application.

![Flow Chart](docs/flowchart.jpeg)

For PDF version [click here](docs/flowchart-pdf.pdf)


## Database structure

Google Sheets service is used to store project's database in the spreadsheet.

# Features

## Existing Features

### Introduction Section

The program is run, terminal window displays the main menu of the typing speed test application. It prints the game logo followed by a numbered list of options using [Colorama]("https://pypi.org/project/colorama/").

![Terminal Intro](docs/terminal-intro.png)


### Options menu

The menu continously displays options list using the loop. To continue using the application, the user is prompted to choose one of the options from 1 to 6. Following the user's selection, the function verifies the input to make sure it is within the permitted range of possibilities. An error message asking the user to select the correct option is presented if the input is invalid. The related action linked to the selected choice is carried out if the input is valid. This functionality ensures seamless navigation through the application's features and facilitates user interaction.

<details><summary><b>Options Menu Functionality</b></summary>

![Options Menu Functionality](docs/options-menu.png)

</details><br


### View Instructions

 It presents users with a set of guidelines to follow while taking the typing test. The instructions are printed in the terminal with colorized text to enhance readability and user experience. After displaying the instructions, the function prompts users to return to the main menu, facilitating seamless navigation within the application.

<details><summary><b>View Instructions Display</b></summary>

</details><br/>

### Test


 It begins by requesting user for their name. Name must be at least two characters. Then it generates a random paragraph for the user to type, which is displayed in the terminal with colorized text. The user is then prompted to begin typing, and their input is recorded. Once the user has finished typing, the function calculates and displays the results of the typing test, including accuracy and speed. It measures time taken in the background for calculations. This function serves as the core component of the typing speed test game, allowing users to assess and improve their typing skills within the terminal environment.Users are also given an option to either save test results or to return to the main menu.

### Typing Advice 

 It displays a list of 12 tips and tricks in the terminal, each designed to improve typing proficiency. It starts by presenting a list of 12 quick fixes in the terminal, all aimed at enhancing typing speed. To make the experience more interactive, users are required to press Enter in order to reveal each advice. Important methods including touch typing, good posture, finger positioning, and consistent practice are covered in the suggestions. The functionality also suggests that users take pauses, practice typing using games, and track their advancement over time. Users can improve their accuracy and speed while strengthening their typing skills by implementing these tips. At the end of the the function takes users back to the main menu so they can continue using the typing speed test application after applying these instructions.

![Tips and Tricks Display](docs/tips-tricks-display.png)

</details><br/>

### Practice Accuracy

The user is prompted to practice accurately typing a paragraph that is created at random by the Practice Accuracy function as accuracy is imperative for speed typing skills. The function determines the accuracy of the user's input in relation to the original text once they have completed typing. The user sees a green text message congratulating them on reaching 100% accuracy. If not, the user is shown with a red letter that indicates their accuracy percentage. After that, the function asks the user if they want to attempt inputting the paragraph again. The user can start the practice again or return to main menu.

### Exit Application

Provides users with a confirmation prompt to confirm whether they want to exit the application. It operates within a loop to continuously prompt the user until a valid response is received. The prompt asks users to confirm whether they are sure they want to quit the application, giving them the option to respond with "Y" for yes or "N" for no.
Once a valid response is received, the function checks if the user confirmed they want to quit by entering "Y". If the confirmation is affirmative, the function clears the terminal screen, prints a thank-you message to acknowledge the user's usage of the application, and terminates the program.
If the user chooses not to exit the application by entering "N" or an invalid response, the function clears the terminal screen and returns the user to the main menu.

While building the application, the general principles of accessibility where adhered to: 

- Using clear instructions
- Asking for user input before continuing
- Validating inputs before moving on to the next step
- Testing the game to make sure it does not crash from user input
- Using ARIA labels in the README
